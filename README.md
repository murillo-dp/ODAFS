# Decentralized Healthcare Funding Management System (ODAFS)

## Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering Final Project

### Overview
This repository contains the comprehensive work for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering Final Project. The project focuses on the development of a decentralized organization for the management of healthcare funds. The system is designed to streamline and enhance the process of allocating funds for medical treatments through the utilization of blockchain technology.

### Project Components

#### 1. Backend
The backend component of the system is responsible for handling the logic and operations related to the decentralized healthcare funding management. It is implemented in Solidity, a programming language specifically designed for smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain.

#### 2. Frontend
The frontend serves as the user interface, enabling users to interact with the decentralized system seamlessly. Developed using modern web technologies, the frontend provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for individuals seeking healthcare funding.

#### 3. Memory (Documentation)
The "memory" directory contains comprehensive documentation, written in Spanish, detailing the project's objectives, architecture, and implementation details. This documentation serves as a guide for understanding the system's functionality and its underlying technologies.

### Technologies Used
- **Solidity:** The smart contracts, responsible for managing funds and user interactions, are implemented in the Solidity programming language.
- **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens):** The project leverages the concept of NFTs to represent user credentials, ensuring secure and unique identification within the decentralized system.

### How to Use
1. **Backend:**
   - Navigate to the 'backend' directory.
   - Deploy the Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Go to the 'frontend' directory.
   - Set up the frontend application to connect with the deployed smart contracts.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Access the 'memory' directory for in-depth documentation in Spanish, providing insights into the project's objectives, architecture, and usage instructions.

### Project Workflow
1. Users register and obtain a unique credential in the form of an NFT.
2. With their credentials, users can request funds for medical treatments through the decentralized organization.
3. The smart contracts validate and process funding requests, ensuring a transparent and secure allocation of healthcare funds.
